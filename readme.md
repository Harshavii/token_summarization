FLASK APPLICATION: PROMPT

Used flask framework along with flask-bootstrap in this assignment.
To run the flask application, all required packages are included in requirements.txt file.

For this task, I employed a summarization algorithm to enhance token count efficiency.
I utilized the t5 model from Hugging Face's transformer library, which employs an
abstractive approach to summarization. Additionally, I experimented with the bert model,
which adopts an extractive approach, but the outcomes were not as optimal as those
achieved using the abstractive approach.
Basically, in this task, the utilization of a machine learning-based approach gave more optimal
results when compared to nltk, spacy and rule-based approach.
